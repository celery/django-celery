- Adds Django migrations

    ... warning::

        Old South migrations have been moved to ``djcelery.south_migrations``,

                'djcelery': 'djcelery.south_migrations',

:by: Ask Solem

Important Notes
---------------

The 3.0 changelog forgot to mention that two of the database

the tables or alter the tables manually::

            ADD meta TEXT NULL DEFAULT "";

        ALTER TABLE djcelery_crontabschedule
            ADD day_of_month VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL DEFAULT "*";

        ALTER TABLE djcelery_crontabschedule
            ADD month_of_year VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL DEFAULT "*";

3.0.0
=====
:release-date: 2012-07-07 01:00 P.M BST
:by: Ask Solem

.. _v300-important:

Important Notes
---------------

- Now depends on Celery 3.0

    It is important that you read the What's New document for the 3.0 series:
    http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/whatsnew-3.0.html

- No longer depends on :mod:`django-picklefield`

    And as such the result backend will no longer deepcopy return
    values or exceptions.

- Celery 3.0 is the last release to require django-celery

    Starting with Celery 3.1 the django-celery package will no longer be
    required and Celery will support Django out of the box.

    The django-celery package may still exist for some time to provide
    additional utilities like the django-admin monitor.

- django-celery 3.0 is the last series to support Python 2.5.

    Celery will no longer support Python 2.5 starting with version 3.1.

- New :program:`manage.py celery` umbrella command replaces older commands.

    All commands except for :program:`manage.py celeryevcam` can
    now be started using the new umbrella command::

        $ manage.py celery worker -l info           # <<< NEW
        $ manage.py celeryd -l info                 # <-- OLD

        $ manage.py celery status                   # <<< NEW
        $ manage.py celeryctl status                # <-- OLD

        $ manage.py celery beat -l info             # <<< NEW
        $ manage.py celerybeat -l info              # <-- OLD

        $ manage.py celery multi start ...          # <<< NEW
        $ manage.py celeryd_multi start ...         # <-- OLD

        $ manage.py celery amqp queue.delete celery # <<< NEW
        $ manage.py camqadm queue.delete celery     # <-- OLD

    See ``manage.py celery help`` for a complete list of supported commands.

    The old commands will still work, but you are encouraged to start
    using the new umbrella command.

- The distribution :file:`contrib/` directory is now renamed to
  :file:`extra/`.

- The django-celery source code repository has moved

    The new location is at http://github.com/celery/django-celery

=====
:release-date: 2012-02-24 02:00 P.M GMT
:by: Ask Solem

.. _v250-important:

Important Notes
---------------

* Now depends on Celery 2.5.

* Database schema has been updated.

    After upgrading you need migrate using South, or migrate manually
    as described below.

    These changes means that expiring results will be faster and
    take less memory than before.

    In addition a description field to the PeriodicTask model has
    been added so that the purpose of a periodic task
    in the database can be documented via the Admin interface.

    **South Migration**

    To migrate using South execute the following command::

        $ python manage.py migrate djcelery

    If this is a new project that is also using South then you need
    to fake the migration:

        $ python manage.y migrate djcelery --fake

    **Manual Migration**

    To manually add the new fields,

    using PostgreSQL:

    .. code-block: sql

        ALTER TABLE celery_taskmeta
            ADD hidden BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE;

        ALTER TABLE celery_tasksetmeta
            ADD hidden BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE;

        ALTER TABLE djcelery_periodictask
            ADD description TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT ""

    using MySQL:

    .. code-block:: sql

        ALTER TABLE celery_taskmeta
            ADD hidden TINYINT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0;

        ALTER TABLE celery_tasksetmeta
            ADD hidden TINYINT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0;

        ALTER TABLE djcelery_periodictask
            ADD description TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT "";

    using SQLite:

    .. code-block:: sql

        ALTER TABLE celery_taskmeta
            ADD hidden BOOL NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE;
        ALTER TABLE celery_tasksetmeta
            ADD hidden BOOL NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE;
        ALTER TABLE djcelery_periodictask
            ADD description VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL DEFAULT "";

Important Notes
---------------

This release adds `South`_ migrations, which well assist users in automatically
updating their database schemas with each django-celery release.

.. _`South`: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/South/

.. _240-news:

News
----

* Now depends on Celery 2.4.0 or higher.

* South migrations have been added.

    Migration 0001 is a snapshot from the previous stable release (2.3.3).
    For those who do not use South, no action is required.
    South users will want to read the :ref:`240-upgrade_south` section
    below.

    Contributed by Greg Taylor.

* Test runner now compatible with Django 1.4.

    Test runners are now classes instead of functions,
    so you have to change the ``TEST_RUNNER`` setting to read::

        TEST_RUNNER = "djcelery.contrib.test_runner.CeleryTestSuiteRunner"

    Contributed by Jonas Haag.

.. _240-upgrade_south:

Upgrading for south users
-------------------------

For those that are already using django-celery 2.3.x, you'll need to fake the
newly added migration 0001, since your database already has the current
``djcelery_*`` and ``celery_*`` tables::

    $ python manage.py migrate djcelery 0001 --fake

If you're upgrading from the 2.2.x series, you'll want to drop/reset your
``celery_*`` and ``djcelery_*`` tables and run the migration::

    $ python manage.py migrate djcelery

Important Notes
---------------

This release depends on Celery version 2.1.0.
Be sure to read the Celery changelog before you upgrade:
http://celery.github.com/celery/changelog.html#version-2-1-0

News
----

* The periodic task schedule can now be stored in the database and edited via
  the Django Admin interface.

    To use the new database schedule you need to start ``celerybeat`` with the
    following argument::

        $ python manage.py celerybeat -S djcelery.schedulers.DatabaseScheduler

    Note that you need to add your old periodic tasks to the database manually
    (using the Django admin interface for example).

* New Celery monitor for the Django Admin interface.

    To start monitoring your workers you have to start your workers
    in event mode::

        $ python manage.py celeryd -E

    (you can do this without restarting the server too::

        >>> from celery.task.control import broadcast
        >>> broadcast("enable_events")

    You need to do a syncdb to create the new tables:

        python manage.py syncdb

    Then you need to start the snapshot camera::

        $ python manage.py celerycam -f 2.0

    This will take a snapshot of the events every 2 seconds and store it in
    the database.

Fixes
-----

* database backend: Now shows warning if polling results with transaction isolation level
  repeatable-read on MySQL.

    See http://github.com/celery/django-celery/issues/issue/6

* database backend: get result does no longer store the default result to
  database.

    See http://github.com/celery/django-celery/issues/issue/6

2.0.2
=====

Important notes
---------------

* Due to some applications loading the Django models lazily, it is recommended
  that you add the following lines to your ``settings.py``::

       import djcelery
       djcelery.setup_loader()

    This will ensure the Django celery loader is set even though the
    model modules haven't been imported yet.

News
----

* ``djcelery.views.registered_tasks``: Added a view to list currently known
  tasks.

2.0.0
=====
:release-date: 2010-07-02 02:30 P.M CEST
